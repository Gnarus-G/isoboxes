An implementation of the boxes in the ISO_IEC_14496-12_2015 specs, mainly those to do with Common File Format and DCC Movie Fragments.

### Motivation

To be able to generate a valid mp4 file in memory. It would be cool, specifically to be able to write a buffer for an CMAF mp4 and stream it over http, chunked.
